# Server-rendered to-do app powered by NoFlo running on Heroku

This app runs on Heroku like majority of web apps out there but is entirely
NoFlo! It is not a complete to-do app but shows major aspects of Flow-Based
Programming (FBP) and NoFlo.

## Installation

Locally:

1. `git clone https://github.com/kenhkan/noflo-example-todo-server.git`
2. `foreman start web`
3. Voila!

On Heroku:

1. [Create your app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)
2. Remember the Heroku Postgres add-on!
3. `git clone https://github.com/kenhkan/noflo-example-todo-server.git`
4. `git push heroku master`
5. Voila! Again!
